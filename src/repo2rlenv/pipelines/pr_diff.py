"""PR-diff mining (SWE-RL-style) → Harbor-runnable env.

Generation is text-only (no sandbox): for each merged PR within scope:
  1. Pull metadata (title, body, base/head SHAs, files)
  2. Pull the unified diff via `gh pr diff`
  3. Skip if it touches too many files (likely a refactor) or is empty
  4. Build instruction text (issue/PR description rewritten to drop "Closes #...")
  5. Emit a Harbor task

The *emitted* task is runnable in Docker (when ``emit_harbor_env=True``,
the default): it ships a thin ``python:3.12-slim`` ``environment/Dockerfile``
+ a ``tests/test.sh`` carrying the 6-component diff-similarity verifier
(``_pr_diff_verifier``). Reward kind is ``diff_similarity``; the component
breakdown lands in ``/logs/verifier/reward-details.json``. With
``emit_harbor_env=False`` the task is pure text (instruction.md +
solution/patch.diff) for consumers who score the diff themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acknowledgment

The "text-only PR-as-task with diff-similarity reward" pattern is inspired by:

  Evolution (Wei et al., NeurIPS '25, arXiv:2502.18449)

The PR-mining task formulation is also inherited from:
